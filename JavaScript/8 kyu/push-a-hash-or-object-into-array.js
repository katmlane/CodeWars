// You are trying to put a hash in ruby or an object in javascript or java into an array, but it always returns error, solve it and keep it as simple as possible!
  
  
  
//   items = []
// items.push{a: "b", c: "d"}
  
  


// I wasn't sure what was exactly wrong with this solution so I had to do research. I realized that it was a simple punctuation error. 


  items = []
items.push({a: "b", c: "d"})
