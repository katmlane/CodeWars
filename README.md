# CodeWars

CodeWars' problem solving coding exercises challenges the way I think about programming languages in practical applications of the code. I am primarly testing my JavaScript knowledge at the moment. I plan to explore React.js in the near future. This repository contains my codewars solutions as a beginner Softwar Engineer. They are organized by programming language and kata kyu level.

## Leveling System

**Tech used:** JavaScript... other languages to follow

## Optimizations

I plan on revisiting each of my CodeWars solutions as extend my programming language knowledge. My goal is concise code that is easily readable for other users.

## Lessons Learned:

So far I have learned that there are four primary troubleshooting solutions I can use during my coding to ensure a clean and readable finished product.
1. Start with clear pseudocode
2. Console.log(everything)
3. Check your spelling and syntax
4. Be sure you are returning the data you want, or returning it period (see #2)

As I collect experiences/lessons I will update this list.
